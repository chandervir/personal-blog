            <h1>AFFORDABILITY</h1>
            <p>Apple has always been at the high end of the market in terms of pricing, but the iPhone X took things to a whole new level with a starting price of $1,000 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max starts at $1,100. If you need something more affordable, the iPhone 11 starts from $700 and the latest iPhone SE from $400. That’s as cheap as it gets unless you delve into the secondhand market.
                For sheer scale and variety, nothing competes with Android. You can spend a lot if you want to, — for example, Samsung’s newest Z lineup costs nearly $1,400, but there’s also a huge selection of good, low-cost handsets from a wide variety of different manufacturers, and the platform has been deliberately optimized to run on low-end hardware. The fact that Android also leads the field in free apps makes it the natural choice for the budget-conscious.
