            <h1>APPLICATIONS</h1>
            <p>Let’s start with a look at the numbers. This is roughly how many apps you’ll find in the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store:
                Android apps: 2.5 million
                iOS apps: 1.8 million
                Truthfully, numbers aren’t the best metric because most of us only use a handful of apps and the most popular ones are available on both platforms. Traditionally, iOS has been a more lucrative platform for developers, so there has been a tendency for new apps to appear there first, but that is changing as Android’s market share continues to grow. In the U.S., iOS still leads the way, but developers elsewhere are increasingly targeting Android first.
                Luckily, both operating systems have been taking more precautions when it comes to malicious apps and spyware, making apps safer to download than ever.
                The Play Store still has a higher percentage of free apps than the App Store. But the best mobile games still land on iOS first — and they don’t always come to Android. Ultimately, quality beats quantity and so this is a narrow win for iOS.<br>
                <strong>Winner: iOS</strong>
